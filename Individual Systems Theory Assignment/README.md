# CS4320/7320 Software Engineering
***Individual Assignment***

## Steps
1. Review each of the four articles on systems theory in the [readings]((https://github.com/MUSoftwareEngineering/Student-Materials/tree/main/01-systems-thinking-and-ethics/readings))
2. ~~Review the lecture and slides on Systems Theory~~ 
3. Consider one of these public cases where ethical boundaries were crossed (to varying degrees, depending on your perspective). 
 - A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit
 - Edward Snowden's release of Top Secret information about National Security Administration security and surveillance practices
 - Cambridge Analytica's use of fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential vote in the United States of America
4. For whichever case you chose, make a spreadsheet where the first column is "Ethical Quandry", and the subsequent columns are for listing individual systems affected. I want you to think about technical systems, as well as larger scale socio-technical systems. 
5. In each cell, place a checkbox for each ethical quandry that affected each system. Review class video from Tuesday to better understand the context for this action. 
6. Write two paragraphs summarizing your grid. 
7. Commit your grid, and the summary to a GitHub repository (public or private) that GitHub user "sgoggins" can access. 
8. Submit a link to that repository in Canvas as your assignment.

### Ethical Quandary: Retailer Selling Personal Information

The spreadsheet illustrates the ethical quandary of a retailer selling personal information for profit and identifies the potential impacts on various systems, such as technical and socio-technical systems. This practice raises concerns related to privacy violation, data security breaches, erosion of trust, exploitative practices, and unfair commercialization. 

**Technical Systems:** Data security and privacy mechanisms within the retailer's infrastructure are directly affected. 

**Socio-Technical Systems:** The socio-technical systems are equally important, as this action can lead to a loss of trust between consumers and businesses, potentially altering purchasing behaviors. Legal and regulatory systems governing data protection may also be challenged by such practices.

This case can raise an interesting ethical discussion as data harvesting is on the rise. There is an important discussion to be had on who owns your data: is it those who have collected it from your activity or is it yours because it is information about you. Pretty much anywhere you go online, they are collecting data about you, either to alter the site to a more personalized experience, or to sell so other companies can better market to you.

What should the restrictions be, if there should be any restrictions at all? Is the terms and conditions enough, or should places be more transparent about what information they are collecting? It's an important conversation to be had.
